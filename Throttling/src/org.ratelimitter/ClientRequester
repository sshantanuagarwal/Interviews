Traffic shaping
Requirement:
      Create framework that can throttle client requests in distributed
system.
      Throttling could be on multiple level i.e per client, per endpoint
etc.
      In case client limit has breached the framework should reject the
request with appropriate http status.
      This framework can be included in any service to throttle client
requests accross all its instances.

Exmaple:
client: E-COM
      limit:
           HOUR -> 100
           WEEK -> 900
           MONTH  -> 10000
      specialization:
          type: METHOD
                 - GET :
             limit:
                   SEC -> 10
                   MIN -> 50
                   WEEK -> 700
       - POST :
             limit:
                   SEC -> 20
                   HOUR -> 40
                   WEEK -> 900
                   MONTH -> 1000
type: API
       - /status :
             limit:
